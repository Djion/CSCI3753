---Executables---
./testscript - A simple bash script for running a few sample test cases
./pi-sched - A simple program for statistically calculating pi using
             a specific scheduling policy
./rw-sched - A simple i/o bound program using a specific scheduling policy
./mixed-sched - A simple program that is both I/O and CPU bound, using a specific scheduling policy
./FINALRUN - A bash script that runs testscript 10 times

---Examples---
Build:
 make

Clean:
 make clean

pi-sched:
 ./pi-sched
 ./pi-sched <Number of Iterations>
 ./pi-sched <Number of Iterations> <Scheduling Policy>
 ./pi-sched <Number of Iterations> <Scheduling Policy> <Priority Variation>
 ./pi-sched <Number of Iterations> <Scheduling Policy> <Priority Variation> <Concurrent Variation>
rw-sched:
 ./rw-sched
 ./rw-sched <#Bytes to Write to Output File>
 ./rw-sched <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size>
 ./rw-sched <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size> <Input Filename>
 ./rw-sched <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size> <Input Filename> <Output Filename>
 ./rw-sched <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size> <Input Filename> <Output Filename> <Priority Variation> <Concurrent Variation>
mixed-sched:
 ./mixed-sched
 ./mixed-sched <Number of Iterations>
 ./mixed-sched <Number of Iterations> <Scheduling Policy>
 ./mixed-sched <Number of Iterations> <Scheduling Policy> <Priority Variation>
 ./mixed-sched <Number of Iterations> <Scheduling Policy> <Priority Variation> <Concurrent Variation>
testscript:
 ./testscript
 
Valid Options for above flags:
<Number of Iterations> :  Any integer > 0
<Scheduling Policy>    :  SCHED_OTHER
                          SCHED_FIFO
                          SCHED_RR
<Priority Variation>   :  0 = Same Priority
                          1 = Random Priority
<Concurrent Variation> :  LOW = 5-10 Concurrent Processes
                          MED = 10 - 100 Concurrent Processes
                          HIGH = 100 - 1000 Concurrent Processes
<#Bytes to Write>      :  Any Integer > 0
<Block Size>           :  Any Integer > 0
<Input Filename>       :  Name of input file
<Output Filename>      :  Name of output file
